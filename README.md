# TheWorld
Is a study project done for my school, it's a prototype of a webpage for an online TTRPG codded in HTML, CSS, and PHP.

Although my code is open-source to anyone, I don't own any of the images used, as they were merely used as study material, so be wary of that.
Other than that, feel free to use my code however you'd like.
